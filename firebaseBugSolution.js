The solution involves careful data type validation before interacting with the Firebase database and robust error handling within transactions.  Ensure that data sent to Firebase conforms precisely to the schema of the database.  For transactions, always handle potential errors (`catch` blocks) and use appropriate retry mechanisms for transient failures.  Also, keep transactions as short as possible to minimize their impact on the database.
