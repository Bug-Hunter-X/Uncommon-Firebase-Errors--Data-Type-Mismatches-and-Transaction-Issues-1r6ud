The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided data is not correctly formatted for the database type. For instance, trying to insert an array into a field that expects a map might lead to a silent failure or unexpected behavior.  Another common error is when dealing with transactions.  Improperly structured transactions or failing to handle potential errors within transactions can lead to data inconsistencies or application crashes.
